GET [integer based]

When we enter any random string we get an error from the database.
after addinga  single quote we get the following error
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near ‘\’ LIMIT 0,1′ at line 1


query used is:
Select * from TABLE where id = 1’ ;

so odd number of single quotes is showing an error and also the string will break the query
so we comment out the rest of the query --+
