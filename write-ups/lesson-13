When we login with username & password as admin' we get an error

You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'admin'') LIMIT 0,1' 
at line 1

we use ‚Äù or 1 # to bypass the login and we have success. The reason is that the 1 used after OR resolves to true and as a result we have successful query. 
The password is not matched since we commented out the rest of the query.
