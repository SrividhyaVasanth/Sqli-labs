POST-ERROR BASED SINGLE QUOTES

We have to login by entering a username and password

when we add a single quote next to "admin" we get an error
You have an error in your SQL syntax; check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near 'admin'' LIMIT 0,1' at line 1

We need to fix the error by using '#' 
username & password :admin'#

query used is 
Select * from TABLE where username= (“$uname”) and password=(“$password”) limit 0,1

username and password :admin' or 1=1#
